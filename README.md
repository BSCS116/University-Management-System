# 📚 University Management System (Java OOP Project)

This is a simple Java console application demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles by modeling a university system with departments, students, courses, and teachers.

## 📌 Project Description

A basic university management system where:
- **Departments** have names and IDs.
- **Students** have names, IDs, and ages.
- **Courses** have IDs, titles, and related departments.
- **Teachers** have names, IDs, and assigned courses.

Each class contains relevant attributes and methods. The program creates objects for each entity and displays their details using `System.out.println()`.

## 📚 Concepts Used

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Method Definitions**
- **Object Instantiation**
- **Main Method Execution**

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java (JDK 21)
- IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / NetBeans / Any preferred Java IDE
